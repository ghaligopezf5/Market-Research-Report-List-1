<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous Membrane Dryers</li><li>Non-Porous Membrane Dryers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The membrane dryers market is divided into two main types: porous membrane dryers and non-porous membrane dryers. Porous membrane dryers utilize materials with tiny openings to selectively allow certain gas molecules to pass through, effectively separating moisture from air or other gases. Non-porous membrane dryers, on the other hand, employ dense materials that create a barrier, relying on pressure differences to remove moisture without allowing gas molecules to permeate. Both types are essential for applications requiring efficient drying processes in various industries.</p></p>
