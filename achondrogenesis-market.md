<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Achondrogenesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Achondrogenesis Type IA</li><li>Achondrogenesis Type IB</li><li>Achondrogenesis Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Achondrogenesis is classified into three types based on genetic and clinical characteristics. Type IA is caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene, leading to severe skeletal abnormalities and typically resulting in early neonatal death. Type IB involves mutations in the COL11A1 gene, presenting with similar but distinct skeletal features. Type II, known as Langer-Saldino achondrogenesis, arises from mutations in the EXT2 gene and may allow for longer survival but still results in significant fetal skeletal deformities. Each type has unique implications for diagnosis and treatment strategies in the market.</p></p>
