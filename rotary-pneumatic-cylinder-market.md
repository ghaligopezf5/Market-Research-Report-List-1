<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Pneumatic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Acting</li><li>Single Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary pneumatic cylinder market is categorized into two main types: double acting and single acting cylinders. Double acting cylinders use air pressure to move the actuator in both directions, offering better control and force, making them ideal for demanding applications. In contrast, single acting cylinders operate using air pressure in one direction, relying on a spring or external force to return, making them simpler and often more cost-effective for lightweight tasks. Both types serve various industrial automation needs.</p></p>
