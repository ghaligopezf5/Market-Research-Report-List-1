<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas-powered Tankless Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas-powered tankless water heater market is divided into two main types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing units utilize a secondary heat exchanger to capture and reuse exhaust gases, resulting in higher energy efficiency and lower emissions. In contrast, non-condensing models vent exhaust directly, which can lead to energy loss. While condensing units tend to have a higher upfront cost, they offer long-term savings and environmental benefits, making them increasingly popular among consumers seeking sustainable options.</p></p>
